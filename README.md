# lumino

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jupyterlab/lumino.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jupyterlab/lumino)

lumino is a set of JavaScript packages, written in TypeScript, that provide
a rich set of widgets, layouts, events, and data structures. These enable
developers to construct advanced, production-quality, desktop-like web
applications that would be otherwise impossible using CSS alone.

It is a fork of the [PhosphorJS library](https://github.com/phosphorjs/phosphor).

lumino follows the Jupyter [Community Guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).
